CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Typically a file is made with a .css stylesheet file that formats your CSS for your entire website of numerous pages. <br>
Examples: Make the colours Red and Green on Christmas, Pink on Valentines Day, and Green on St. Patrick's Day. <br><br>

CSS can also be used in the Style part of any webpage that defines colours and such for the whole page. <br><br>

Mr. Ellis teaches "inline CSS" the most powerful type. All web pages have a CSS style to control it. <br><br>
<b>This isn't cool.</b>
<b style="color:#000080; background:#00FF00; border:2px solid #0000FF">Now this is insane.</b><br><br>

  <span>This is a span doing nothing at all</span>
  <span style="position:absolute; left:100; top:400; border-color: maroon; border-style:groove; border-width:8; width:60">This span does nothing but something.<span><br><br>
