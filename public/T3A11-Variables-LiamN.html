<h3>What about Javascript?</h3>
Javascript stores <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> as strings.

<h3>Why is that good and bad?</h3>
Super easy, causes some problems.<br>

We need to understand document. let, var, and nothing.<br>
var is global
let is local both still have issues
I use nothing for local and document. for always global.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<input type=button value="easy variable" onclick="{
myW = 5
var myX = "6"
let myY = 7
document.myZ = 8
alert('myW = '+ myW)
alert('myX = '+ myX)
}">
