  <p>I've been thinking of potential games I want to make.</p><br>
  <p>I've always been mesmerized by turn based RPGs like Pokemon or Fire Emblem.</p><br>
  <p>I've also found the whole "Artes" thing in the Tales series pretty neat.</p><br>
  <p>I'm curious about making a game like that in homage to my favourite series, but I don't have a full story at the moment.</p><br><br>
  
  <p>So maybe I'll think of some other kinda game!</p><br>
  <p>But we'll see.</p>
